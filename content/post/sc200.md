# "Defender for Autopilot"

### A proxmox VM prepped for Autopilot, brought into Azure, reset, enrolled new, then brought into Defender for Endpoint. 


[![N|Solid](/defender_autopilot/auto01.png)](https://sludge.one/sc200)

On the device itself I opened elevated powershell and ran:

```powershell

Install-Script -Name Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo
Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo.ps1 -Outputfile C:\hardwareinfo.csv

```


Update: 
Since doing this, I found a better snippet to use:

```powershell

md c:\HWID
Set-Location c:\HWID

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force

Install-Script -Name Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -Force

$env:Path += ";C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Scripts"

Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo.ps1 -OutputFile AutopilotHWID.csv

```

Yeah! Make it hurt, Microsoft! So now that we have this ugly hardware hash for an identifier…


Browse to the endpoint portal on the vm and upload the hardwareinfo.csv

Some bullshit name from the proxmox VM

See associated Azure AD Device?

I grab this information and throw it in notepad, because it may come up later or may enable us to do something way faster from the command line. I love Azure's portal. After using AWS and that virtual shopping cart of a management console I can't complain, but once you get familiar with the command line and what all things you need it's a time saver. I think amazon did a better job with their cli but azure lets us use more powershell, and when have you woken up and not wanted to use more powershell?  

This where things started getting…just…messy and confusing, like usual with these tutorials 2 months to 2 years old. Some of these guides are just severely outdated that I'm following. I like to follow with a guide and open the Microsoft Docs relevant to that topic and use the outdated guides to have a bit of a roadmap so I don't get lost in the sea of legacy configurations and services. We get it, ya got SQL.  

Back to the docs…

*** I ended up Enabling the device, but this caught my eye while reading about devices in Azure AD:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/device-management-azure-portal#enable-or-disable-an-azure-ad-device

We should reset the VM to the OOBE Experience. I searched "reset" in the searchbox at the bottom and chose "Reset this PC" from System Settings.

Hop over to the portal and go to:
Azure Active Directory > Mobility (MDM and MAM) > Microsoft Intune

Notice that other Intune? Yeah, me too. Let's check it out.

[![N|Solid](/defender_autopilot/auto11.png)](https://sludge.one/sc200)

I set it to all, and THEN went to read about it, and it looks like it's something we don't need
*********TODO Explain why we don’t need it


*****TODO a little thing on cool Company Branding


****TODO Groups

So I ended up assigning it directly to my admin user account. I want to see what this does, and then come back to the guide later.

Created a securioty group called AutoPilot lab and was able to assign the device to that group, and devswarm as well

[![N|Solid](/defender_autopilot/auto12.png)](https://sludge.one/sc200)

[![N|Solid](/defender_autopilot/auto13.png)](https://sludge.one/sc200)

Lets create our deploiyment profile:

[![N|Solid](/defender_autopilot/auto14.png)](https://sludge.one/sc200)

Assign our new group on the nest pane

[![N|Solid](/defender_autopilot/auto15.png)](https://sludge.one/sc200)

[![N|Solid](/defender_autopilot/auto16.png)](https://sludge.one/sc200)

YES!!!!! Company Branding. I didn’t do any really. Lets see if we can log in as devswarm.

***TODO This comment looks like an interesting thing to explore
We’ve discovered a loophole. If the user enters their email address wrong into the first login screen after resetting the laptop (after the machine has been through autopilot setup once and has been joined to the domain), Windows gives them an option to set up a local account.
Is there any way to suppress the option to create a local account?

[![N|Solid](/defender_autopilot/auto18.png)](https://sludge.one/sc200)

We're in! I had a lot of trouble with getting this working the first couple of time, its nice to have it work smoothly.

**nugget:
Security baselines are pre-configured groups of Windows settings that help you apply the security settings that are recommended by the relevant security teams. You can also customize the baselines you deploy to enforce only those settings and values you require.
Another great asset is the option to do versioning and filtering based on different Operating Systems or scenarios that have to be more strict. You no longer have to use GPOs to ensure that the security settings on your endpoints – just create a Security baseline profile and you’re all set.

Going to rock almost all of the default settings in block mode. Who cares, we'll roll it back anyway

[![N|Solid](/defender_autopilot/auto21.png)](https://sludge.one/sc200)

Did this for Windows 10 baseline, the Defener baseline and edge. All defaults assigned to Autopilot lab
Make sure you're licensed up for Defender
